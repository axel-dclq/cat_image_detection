# Cat Image Classification Project

Welcome to my Cat Image Classification project, a culmination of my deep learning journey through the specialization provided by deeplearning.ai, accessible at [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

## Project Overview

This project is divided into two distinct notebooks. The first notebook focuses on implementing a Multilayer Neural Network (NN layer network) for image classification. The model is built with specific dimensions defined by `layers_dims = [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1]`, constituting a four-layer neural network. Emphasis is placed on the manual implementation of forward and backward propagation functions, providing an in-depth understanding of neural network architecture and the nuances of gradient descent.

The second notebook delves into a different approach to classification, implementing a sigmoid-based classification model in the form of a one-neuron network. This approach offers an alternative perspective on solving the binary classification problem.

## Specialization Background

This project stems from the Deep Learning Specialization offered by deeplearning.ai. This comprehensive specialization has equipped me with a profound understanding of various aspects of deep learning, covering neural networks, convolutional networks, and sequential models. The skills and knowledge gained during this specialization have been crucial in shaping and executing this image classification project.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop a practical understanding of neural network architecture.
- Manually implement forward and backward propagation functions.
- Explore the nuances of gradient descent and optimization processes.
- Apply deep learning principles to the binary image classification task.

This project serves not only as a showcase for my practical skills in deep learning but also as a platform to share insights gained during the deep learning specialization. I invite you to explore and engage with the outcomes of this endeavor, fostering a deeper understanding of the dynamic field of deep learning.

Feel free to reach out for any questions or collaborations. Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey into the world of deep learning and image classification!
